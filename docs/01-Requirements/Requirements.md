title: Module's Requirements
---
## Overview

The table below are requirements formed based on the needs of Team 307's project. This portion heavily focuses on the Human Machine Interface (HMI). In order to achieve this, I have decided to be focusing on the OLED module which allows users to interact with the machine through the screen. There is a stretch goal of having a functionally usable controller to allow users to manually control the movement of the machine through bluetooth. Addition to that, the table also focuses on other aspects to make sure communication between teammates is achieved and that this fills the requirements individually.

## Module Requirement
